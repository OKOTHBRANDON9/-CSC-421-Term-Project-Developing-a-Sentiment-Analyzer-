If you cheating on your customers #Mamaearth trust me on this you can't fool people more than once. Now I know that your Brand is not good enough. I am not going to buy any product from your Brand again.Thumbs down for mamaearth onion oil !!\n",

      "2)Used This Mama Earth Newly Launched Onion Oil twice, and i must say im already impressed by the results !It prevents hair loss, helps control premature greying, dryness, dandruff, scalp eruptions and many other hair problems after its regular use !To avoid dry and frizzy hair, make sure that you use this oil to your hairs twice a week.Oiling provides your scalp with essential nutrients, and also strengthens the hair roots. Mamaearth onion oil works best for your hair during all the seasons.\n",

I just used to forget all the time, finally I have it now.Well from the last 2 months of use, here's my experience with the product:I use it every night and get a shower in the morning.Pros:1. The oil is non greasy, and pretty light.2. Has very good smell.no pungent or awkward fragrance3. My hair doesn't lump in together as with other hair oil products.4.Gives a pretty good shine and dark color5. It's very helpful for dandruff, hairfall/ hairloss. I don't have a very dense hair presence so my scalp was visible all the time, Now it looks pretty dense.Cons.1 .can't find anything at allI do recommend it for people having hairfall issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "5)It's a very good product from mamaearth. The oil gives your hair full strength and perfect shine. Onion are rich in sulphur thats add up the strength of hair roots and holds the hair preventing hairloss. Suitable for all type hair. For better result use at night. Go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "6)Why are you showing onion oil benefits in your ad , when you ate not giving onion oil in your product. I bought this for redensyl content ...but not sure about the percentage of it bein added. Secondly it only has onion extracts, which am sure not is effective.Switchin back to my conventional method of makin onion juice and applyin on scalp\n",
      "\n",
      "7)I used it only one time so I can't say about hairfall control but I couldn't stop myself to mention about its amazing effect. It made my hair extremely soft and shiny which was visible properly. Smell was strong but not bothering. I think this is the best hair fall which I have used till date. My search ends over here I suppose. Just waiting to see its impact on arresting hairfall.\n",

      "15)Nice one... My 2.5 yr old son likes to brush with this flavour- strawberry. Previously I used to use Chicco but switched to this one due to good reviews and lower price.I had used Mee Mee also but this one's ingredients are better for my child's health.\n",
      "\n",
      "16)Berry flavoured blast that the kids just love!  And the best part is that its perfectly fine if  they swallow it too! Made with 100% safe ingredients, this should be the toothpaste you should introduce your kids to! Mamaearth Berry Blast toothpaste is 100% safe and toxin free. My kids love the Berry taste while brushing. This is one of the best flouride free tooth pastes available for kids that you should be buying right away!\n",
      "\n",
      "17)Well how much a 12 month old with 4 almost 5 teeth brushes. But this product is good to start eating or tasting rather by baby. that way it is natural and taste good. i applied bit on her teeth thn forgot where i kept it.Buy for your own satisfaction if baby is really small and if understands how to brush and spit or eat than go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "18)Pros:1. Natural strawberry flavour.2. SLS & Fluoride free toothpaste.3. 100% vegan.4. Claims to be plastic responsible.Cons:None that I found in the last few months.Verdict:Recommended toothpaste for kids above 1 year. My son likes it. The strawberry flavour is quite noticeable when you're brushing your kid. Wish if this was available as single pack instead of minimum qty as 2 since it takes quite a lot of time to finish the tube when you are taking only a peanut size or less portion for brushingIf you think my review was helpful, don't forget to click the helpful link below the review.\n",
      "\n",
      "19)Very good product. Reliable and very good quality. My child (4YO) loves it. Earlier he was using Chicco toothpaste. Now loving it. Mamaearth is at par with Chicco in quality yet way economical.\n",
      "\n",
      "20)I bought it for my 2 years baby. It's mentioned that even if the child gulps it, then also it won't be harmful. Although I am trying my best to teach my little one how to spit out while brushing.I am happy with the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "21)The important aspect i considered while placing the order was\"its safe, even if swallowed\".Small kids love to brush with it.Its the tooth paste with all safe ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "22)The taste is a bit like mild flavoured bubble gum.... My 2 yr old likes it. Plus it claims to be safe for kids since it is all natural without flouride and SLS (chemical used for foaming).Wish that the quantity was a bit more\n",
      "\n",

Can be used as light mositurising serum for upcoming summers. Hopes it helps!\n",

      "84)Mamaearth's face serum it's just very amazing. I have tried so many products for my face pigmentation problem but this product is superb. Due to this product my pigmentation problem is resolved plus my skin qulaity is improved. It comes with vitamin C which is very essential for healthy skin. So happy to come across this product , superb happy with my glowing skin. I sure trying this product one won't switch to another.\n",

      "85)Fast absorbing & non-greasy Face Serum, Turmeric properties works well for radiant skin and Vitamin C antioxidant properties supporting it very well with reducing acne/dark spots. Using it from the last 15 days and so far it's really working well for me, Can't say about actual result so soon need to wait at least 15-20 days more to check actual results on Face Brightens and Fine Lines Reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "86)I ordered this serum on the recommendation of my very dear friend. The serum comes in a small pump type packaging. After a week of use i can tell that the procuct is effective. The serum keeps the skin hydrated and blooming. The serum provides radiance to the skin thus compatible with every skin tone. It doesnt make your face fairer but it definitely provides glow to the skin. The product is worth a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "87)Um the product is really not for people with sensitive skin. I read good reviews on Amazon and ordered it (I was using vitamin c products from other brands which are really expensive so I thought I could give this a try since this is very affordable). But within a week of use I started breaking out all over my face, the big zits kind. I had to stop using within a week of its use. May be the product works for non-sensitive skin, product is really light, can’t tell if it gives any kind of moisture to the skin. I had to change my entire skin care routine, bought my tried and tested organic products and my skin is much much better. I don’t trust mamaearth any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "88)I was really hoping that this serum will be as good as the mcaffeine face serum.....But after using 1whole bottle of it.....I really can't see any visible changes on my skin.....It didn't reduced my pigmentation....And it is really very liquidy in consistency that it dries out my skin.....I have to apply a moisturizer after using this serum. Well it didn't worked for me at all.....Wasted 😢\n",
      "\n",
      "89)Just go for it. Before I started using it I had spots on my face from breakouts and uneven skintone it's been around 15 days since I started using it and I have noticed spots are lighter than before and I can see my skintone getting even than before. Its easily observe in the skin within a minute.The only downside is it's smell but it's not pungent or discomforting one.\n",

The package delivered was suitable and fine look wise. But, after applying on face for a week, her forehead started to develop rashes accompanied by itchiness. She had to literally stop it and wait till it heals which took  more than two weeks. Personally I would not recommend this product to any of the ladies out there. It's just a waste of money and time. And ofcourse, I won't get a refund or payback. I am surely disappointed, dissatisfied, and annoyed.\n",

      "91)Frankly I have ordered this product after seeing so many good reviews..and here is my honest review after using for about 15 days--Does not break my skin- feel light and mositurized- does nothing for my marks or uneven toneSo, the purpose of fading marks or making glowing skin is not at all entertained so far.Yet I want to wait till 1 bottle use. Can be used as light mositurising serum for upcoming summers. Hopes it helps!\n",

      "92)Mamaearth's face serum it's just very amazing. I have tried so many products for my face pigmentation problem but this product is superb. Due to this product my pigmentation problem is resolved plus my skin qulaity is improved. It comes with vitamin C which is very essential for healthy skin. So happy to come across this product , superb happy with my glowing skin. I sure trying this product one won't switch to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "93)Fast absorbing & non-greasy Face Serum, Turmeric properties works well for radiant skin and Vitamin C antioxidant properties supporting it very well with reducing acne/dark spots. Using it from the last 15 days and so far it's really working well for me, Can't say about actual result so soon need to wait at least 15-20 days more to check actual results on Face Brightens and Fine Lines Reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "94)I ordered this serum on the recommendation of my very dear friend. The serum comes in a small pump type packaging. After a week of use i can tell that the procuct is effective. The serum keeps the skin hydrated and blooming. The serum provides radiance to the skin thus compatible with every skin tone. It doesnt make your face fairer but it definitely provides glow to the skin. The product is worth a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "95)Um the product is really not for people with sensitive skin. I read good reviews on Amazon and ordered it (I was using vitamin c products from other brands which are really expensive so I thought I could give this a try since this is very affordable). But within a week of use I started breaking out all over my face, the big zits kind. I had to stop using within a week of its use. May be the product works for non-sensitive skin, product is really light, can’t tell if it gives any kind of moisture to the skin. I had to change my entire skin care routine, bought my tried and tested organic products and my skin is much much better. I don’t trust mamaearth any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "96)I was really hoping that this serum will be as good as the mcaffeine face serum.....But after using 1whole bottle of it.....I really can't see any visible changes on my skin.....It didn't reduced my pigmentation....And it is really very liquidy in consistency that it dries out my skin.....I have to apply a moisturizer after using this serum. Well it didn't worked for me at all.....Wasted 😢\n",
      "\n",
      "97)Just go for it. Before I started using it I had spots on my face from breakouts and uneven skintone it's been around 15 days since I started using it and I have noticed spots are lighter than before and I can see my skintone getting even than before. Its easily observe in the skin within a minute.The only downside is it's smell but it's not pungent or discomforting one.\n",

      "143)Mamaearth is always best.  Every product of this brand is awesome.  I love all babies products by Mamaearth. Best part of this soap is SUITABLE FOR EVERY BABY'S DELICATE SKIN even you can try it for your newborns as well.  I'm using it for my baby since birth. Quality same as mentioned. The natural nutrients present in goat milk gets easily absorbed in the delicate skin of your baby and keeps it moisturized for long time.SUITS DRY, ITCHY, ECZEMA PRONE SKIN as well.  Best product. You can purchase it for your baby or for gifting for your loved ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "144)Update: horrible bathing that I have used so far... My 3 year old son developed hives after using the soap and more over it turned him dark... Fragrance too strong... It literally hits you.. Will never buy again...The bar is ok ok... Not so good as it claims.... I used on my kid and feel it doesn't cleanse well.  I have a dry skin... I used for myself on face and found that my skin is still dry after washing... So nothing great about the moisturising part and more over I don't feel fresh after washing my face with this bar... Its like I haven't washed my face.  So I really doubt if it cleanses ur skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "145)Although, it makes a very rich and creamy lather, it starts melting quickly if kept wet. I need to take it out of the bathroom and dry it for the next use as I want to save as much of it as possible because it's costlier than other brands. But, it does a far better job than other brands and it's organic. I'm happy to have this soap in my skincare regimen as an adult who has a very sensitive skin prone to irritation. The best thing about this soap is it doesn't leave any residue, which I'm surprised to see. Other brands leave a thin film which makes skin feel very slippery and smooth and I don't like that. I want my skin to feel naked, fresh and not stripped with moisture. Mamaearth soap as well as the mamaearth baby wash did an excellent job. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "146)Very bad product worth ZERO star. The entire soap turn into a pasty mass after one time use. Not worth buying this product as the second day onwards one has to scoop it with hand like a cream and apply on baby. Bad manufacturing process for this soap. Better they market it in the form of liquid body wash. Moreover, the soapy feel doesn't go from the body on few rinse. Worst than Teddy bar which has similar outcome, but better than this. Dermadew found to best on my trials to find a good soap for my baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "147)I really have started appreciating this brand as the product they made really works well and best part is they are made from safe ingredients. This baby soap is been enriched with goodness  goat milk, oatmeal, Shea butter and coconut based cleanser. The skin of my toddler feels so soft after bath. The shape of the soap is perfect for little one to hold as well. No tears formula of soap is working great. It is very gentle on the skin. The fragrance is so amazing. I highly recommend this moisturizing bath to all mommies and daddies. I specially recommend it for toddlers who are in phase where they want to be independent and bath by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "148)Everytime I used to search baby soap when one going to finish.this time I heard about mamaearth baby soap.lets try but it's been a week i am using it for my daughter.now I think my search now going to be ended.it is very mild which is good for baby skin\n",
      "\n",
      "149)A gentle cleansing soap that doesn't dry out skin and leaves a lingering baby fragrance after use. Yet another fabulous stellar product by Mamaearth,  makes a  perfect gift for a baby hamper too.\n",
      "\n",
      "150)The soap is really good and I really appreciate its quality. It leaves baby's skin soft, moisturized and doesn't dry it out at all. However, only after 2 days of use, the soap became a lump of cream and I literally have to keep it in a bowl and scoop out little at a time, like cream to use it. Mamaearth please do something about it without compromising on the quality.\n",

      "151)The soap is creamy and less foamy which means it is sulfate free and has fresh coconut fragrance . You will feel the difference in your babys skin the day you start using it. The packaging is Excellent!!! I give it more than five starts\n",
      "\n",
      "152)Mamaearth is always best.  Every product of this brand is awesome.  I love all babies products by Mamaearth. Best part of this soap is SUITABLE FOR EVERY BABY'S DELICATE SKIN even you can try it for your newborns as well.  I'm using it for my baby since birth. Quality same as mentioned. The natural nutrients present in goat milk gets easily absorbed in the delicate skin of your baby and keeps it moisturized for long time.SUITS DRY, ITCHY, ECZEMA PRONE SKIN as well.  Best product. You can purchase it for your baby or for gifting for your loved ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "153)Update: horrible bathing that I have used so far... My 3 year old son developed hives after using the soap and more over it turned him dark... Fragrance too strong... It literally hits you.. Will never buy again...The bar is ok ok... Not so good as it claims.... I used on my kid and feel it doesn't cleanse well.  I have a dry skin... I used for myself on face and found that my skin is still dry after washing... So nothing great about the moisturising part and more over I don't feel fresh after washing my face with this bar... Its like I haven't washed my face.  So I really doubt if it cleanses ur skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "154)Although, it makes a very rich and creamy lather, it starts melting quickly if kept wet. I need to take it out of the bathroom and dry it for the next use as I want to save as much of it as possible because it's costlier than other brands. But, it does a far better job than other brands and it's organic. I'm happy to have this soap in my skincare regimen as an adult who has a very sensitive skin prone to irritation. The best thing about this soap is it doesn't leave any residue, which I'm surprised to see. Other brands leave a thin film which makes skin feel very slippery and smooth and I don't like that. I want my skin to feel naked, fresh and not stripped with moisture. Mamaearth soap as well as the mamaearth baby wash did an excellent job. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "155)Very bad product worth ZERO star. The entire soap turn into a pasty mass after one time use. Not worth buying this product as the second day onwards one has to scoop it with hand like a cream and apply on baby. Bad manufacturing process for this soap. Better they market it in the form of liquid body wash. Moreover, the soapy feel doesn't go from the body on few rinse. Worst than Teddy bar which has similar outcome, but better than this. Dermadew found to best on my trials to find a good soap for my baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "156)I really have started appreciating this brand as the product they made really works well and best part is they are made from safe ingredients. This baby soap is been enriched with goodness  goat milk, oatmeal, Shea butter and coconut based cleanser. The skin of my toddler feels so soft after bath. The shape of the soap is perfect for little one to hold as well. No tears formula of soap is working great. It is very gentle on the skin. The fragrance is so amazing. I highly recommend this moisturizing bath to all mommies and daddies. I specially recommend it for toddlers who are in phase where they want to be independent and bath by themselves.\n",

      "157)Everytime I used to search baby soap when one going to finish.this time I heard about mamaearth baby soap.lets try but it's been a week i am using it for my daughter.now I think my search now going to be ended.it is very mild which is good for baby skin\n",
      "\n",

      "225)I've been using this Godrej aer pocket for a couple of years now. Yes I understand that the fragrance doesn't last for more than a week. It is very strong the first couple of days and rest of the times it is just a light hint of the scent. Then the gel eventually crystallizes.I figured out a way for a 'juggad'. Basically I never take the gel pack out of the plastic cover. There is a hole at the top to hang individual packs for store displays that I cut. Then with scissors, I carefully make 3 slender cuts. This makes the scent come out soft and not too powerful. It lasts for almost 20 days this way. The violet fragrance (purple) lasts for 25 days with this.Hope this review is helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "226)These champs are better considering they are way to different from the Odonil fresheners we have been using for ages (it's basic law of diminishing returns) I'll encourage you to try them for their fragrance, and they are apt for any room in your apartment. When newly opened the fragrance is too strong that i would kick you in the face with it, but it dissolves when you give it a couple of days.Another good part about this is the concept of hanging it, I usually do in the fall ceiling of my washrooms, and it works pretty well.Word of caution: Don't expect it to last a month, because mine never have. Maximum 20 to 22 days, and then you'll want to replace it with a new one, but if you grab it on a deal on Amazon Pantry, it's quite economical\n",

      "230)I am overall happy with this product. But if you want to maintain freshness in your toilet area make sure you buy little more quantities of this product as it doesn't last very longer in my frank opinion. No complaints about fragrance.

      "234)The misty had kind of a soapy smell but works. Smell is pleasant but hardly you would know about the smell unless you get close to it. The citrus has a sort of tangy smell but i find it better than the misty. Will have to try the violet. Initial days your room will be filled with the pleasant smell but a packet  lasts only for like 14 days. In the latter days you will completely forget about it. If you have the shell to spend then go for it.\n",

When newly opened the fragrance is too strong that i would kick you in the face with it, but it dissolves when you give it a couple of days.Another good part about this is the concept of hanging it, I usually do in the fall ceiling of my washrooms, and it works pretty well.Word of caution: Don't expect it to last a month, because mine never have. Maximum 20 to 22 days, and then you'll want to replace it with a new one, but if you grab it on a deal on Amazon Pantry, it's quite economical\n",
      "\n",
      "237)Used this product.fragrance is excellent and of my liking. Very effective for closed spaces including car, toilet, bathroom, offices etc. Easy to install so no zanzat. Fragrance lasts roughly fifteen days, but during this period it should please you and your guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "238)Seems duplicate product as the fragrance has faded after 5 days of use. Amazon authorities please do a check with supplier of this product,I think now I cannot return the item as I hv opened the packet,but how a buyer can be sure about the product without using the item??I think this can be a fit case to be filed with consumer forum.Buyers DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.SUNIL\n",
      "\n",
      "239)On each box the MRP is mentioned as rs 160 , for pack of 3 packs it become rs480 but they are selling at rs495 for 3 boxes ,Kindly take a action against this\n",
      "\n",
      "240)I am overall happy with this product. But if you want to maintain freshness in your toilet area make sure you buy little more quantities of this product as it doesn't last very longer in my frank opinion. No complaints about fragrance. You would surely love it. So go check this out. Very Good product. It wouldn't disappoint you.\n",
      "\n",
      "241)The smell did not last for a week also. It was strong on the first day. After that one couldn't make out the presence of this product at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "242)I think one the best product I have used...It just freshens ur mood... Better than its odonil counterparts... The scent spreads evenly.. just go for it..\n",
      "\n",
      "243)Some of the packet looks like they have leaked and it is wet all over when you open the seal.  The fragrance does not last for 30 days.  It starts off with very strong smell and within a week it just fades.\n",
      "\n",
      "244)The misty had kind of a soapy smell but works. Smell is pleasant but hardly you would know about the smell unless you get close to it. The citrus has a sort of tangy smell but i find it better than the misty. Will have to try the violet. Initial days your room will be filled with the pleasant smell but a packet  lasts only for like 14 days. In the latter days you will completely forget about it. If you have the shell to spend then go for it.\n",

      "245)To start off, the safe arrived with a Low Battery message, meaning that before I could do anything else, I had to go and get new batteries for this brand new item. Once you get things in order, the safe works well and serves its purpose, however, the manual provided is obsolete, and the instructions do not match up with this product. There are no solutions posted online either. If you want to program the safe, you have to figure it out on your own. The customer service personnel were not helpful either and they kept trying to force me to get a technician to come to my house at the cost of Rs. 500 just to program the device, which completely defeats the purpose of online shopping. Don't fall for it. This is rather ridiculous for such a big brand like Godrej.In case anyone else needs to re-program their home code, here is what I was able to do. I hope it works for you too:1.) The instructions indicate to press 68#, but it actually means 68(Lock). If the instructions indicate *, try pressing Clear2.) Every time I pressed 68#, I got an error message, so I had to go through all the steps listed below.3.) Before you can change personal code in home mode, you will need to Access The Programming (pg. 6). The code is 751019 which means that there are 6 different features that you can program. Go through all the steps and change the numbers as they suit you. When you get to the last digit, there are no instructions written in the book, so you will have to figure this out on your own. If the last digit is 1, change it to 0 or 9.4.) After going through the programming and changing the last number, you should be able to go back to change the personal code in home mode.5.) If you set your password and it doesn't lock, go back to the programming again, and change the last digit back to what it was originally.Good luck.\n",

      "247)The product was good. But starting it for the first time took me several hours to start and install it properly.Here I will list out all steps so that reading this other people might find it helpful.1. Unwrap the package properly. Look for any damages.2. You will find a set of keys attached in a plastic sachet.3. Use the key to open the locker. There is a white cover near the button panel ,open it to insert keys.4. Inside the locker you will find the manual and wall mounting knots.5. The other side of the keypad panel will contain the battery space which needs 4 AA batteries for the led to start. But before inserting the batteries do see the positive & negative marked side and insert the batteries according to the charge respectively.6. Close the battery lid and led will automatically start working. The battery lid needs a small screw to get fixed. so if u don't find the screw in any plastic packets then use another aftermarket screws or maybe the screw is present inside the locker mechanism.7. The locker mechanism screws can be unlocked by a particular opener which will be given with the mounting knots inside the locker.8. The locker is now ready to use. Remove the keys and use the led to unlock and lock it. The default password is 1234.9. Please donot apply any pressure or try to press the firm bolts of the locker mechanism when the locker is open. Let the motor of the locker do its work.10. If the locker shows any other error message. Do consult the user manual.Note. Please be calm and do things properly or else you might damage the product.\n",

Now I can feel safer by keeping cash, passport and other valuable stuff.Lookwise also it just has a classy touch. It has a proper colored LED display. It works on the battery power and the consumption is very low. You can set your own passcode from the 4-8 digits. I like it beep sound whenever you have to press the keys. In addition it also has 2 emergency keys. Overall now I am very calm ever since this digital safe has been arrived. Of course now I can manage my things for my own peace of mind according to my needs :-).Earlier I never ever used such kind of digital safe but after have been started using  this I found this as exactly as what I expected for.

The fragnance is pretty good but can’t believe that the machinery of this product have timer issues in just less than a month of use. Totally not recommended if you are bot looking to buy this product every month.\n",
      "\n",
      "289)The product is good. The only caveat (as I have noticed so far) is to be careful with the alarm. Don't keep stuff on it after switching the alarm on. Second, I think the alarm tone itself should change. It needs to be ALARMING. The volume needs to be a bit on the higher side as well. One can easily muffle the sound with a blanket type of fabric and make a getaway. That said, it is quite a sleek gadget. Definitely worth more than what one would be paying for. It's a bit heavy, but I guess that needs to be part of the \"package\" so to speak.\n",

      "290)This is very handy and useful. I keep it inside my wardrobe and store my wallet, car key and other loose currency and change in it when I come back from office. So no more  carelessly placed wallet risking small stealing by maid. As I got the wardrobe made recently, I got a specially designed compartment to keep this safe. It works flawlessly and is very easy to operate.  If I want to lock all the other wardrobes at home while going out somewhere, I keep the keys inside this.  no need to carry so many keys with me. One needs to know the purpose of this safe and the way to use it.\n",

      "291)Using it since November 2016.Sleek and elegant. Sits nicely in my cupboard.Useful to keep certain small sized valuables like keys,cash,jewelry,certain documents,watches etc.The touch panel is great, feels soft and is responsive.Velvet lining is great.Portable.Only con I found is that it buzzez even if you close the cupboard door a bit hard.Other than that, Its good to have it.Note: Its not a regular heavy duty safe. Its more of a personal locker as mentioned. Don't expect it to be the most secure thing you can have.\n",

      "292)Awesome packaging done by amazon !!Product review:Pros: 1.Easy to Carry  2.Touch screen is absolutely smooth.  3.Working mini safe with a primitive touch screen run by a 9 volt battery..well that is awesome.  4.Developers and Designers have done a great job in creating a sleek and stylish safe.Cons:  1.Although the safe looks great..not much space to place enough valuables.If u place a mobile,wallet and a wristwatch..space is done for.  2.Inner layer of the safe is made by a grossest material.It's so rough that it can scratch the back side of your iphone if haven't placed carefully.  3.Wiring for this safe can be done better.  4.Default battery provided to you will be a GP 9 volt alkaline battery,Mine was pretty much messySo to sum this up,a fine product for occasional use (routine if you are thrifty enough to spend bucks on batteries) with a stylish look ✌🏻\n",

      "293)I recently gifted this item to my parents on their anniversary. However the product is good and easy to use with a very responsive touch panel , it has to be absolutely stationary else the alarm sets off which makes it difficult to carry during transportation.Also the Godrej support team is not quick in answering your queries and I received a product which had few scratches on it. So, Amazon should ensure that the product appears brand new since the customers are paying them for a brand new product.  Overall it's worth buying for your security needs.\n",

      "294)Product Is Excellent but the packaging was really terrible, I was shocked to see the box damaged like it was thrown in the warehouse or something, luckily the product was in mint condition.The locker is very very useful when you have domestic help around, this locker shall actually keep you stress free, the locker is very easy to operate during day or night due to led backlit number which are illuminated, overall a great buy wish Amazon improves the packaging on this product in the future.....\n",

      "295)If you have maids in the house and want to keep valuables like wallets and regular use small jewellery under lock and key while they go about their household chores and you don't want to carry physical keys either for fear of misplacing and searching for them or simply inconvenient for you, then this is the product to go for. It's small enough to sit on your study table or fit in your cupboard drawer..although you must understand That it can't fit more than 3 or 4 regular size men's wallets and some other knickknacks like ear rings, chains, cards etc. Easy to operate and install by reading instructions in manual. Sturdy enough to dissuade servants from physical tampering. Serves purpose for what it is intended to do.\n",

The black dial and the silver hands and silver marking makes the functioning of the watch look stunning and royal. Dial size is just right. It is definitely not small and it is not very big either. It looks very well balanced on the wrist. And the metal bracelet that comes with it is beautiful and goes perfectly with the timepiece dimension wise and there's no mismatch between them. Go for it without any second guessing. You'll love it ❤️ Thank you Amazon and thank you Titan. Both amazing companies and now you both have a very very happy and loyal customer in me for life.\n",

I feel this toothpaste might actually cause cavity rather than keep it away, from my experience. I immediately shifted back to Pigeon toothpaste for night brushing and the bad breath stopped from the next day onward.  I had purchased it for its all natural properties. Mama Earth team needs to research more on the ingredients on this product. I use other Mama Earth products and they are decent. Not this toothpaste though.\n",

It was annoying since my skin was already dry without it and it made it worse !It is definitely not worth the money ( I got it for 175rs in a sale.

On 1st day itself I got rashes on my skin but I ignored it. Later on my whole face got rashes and small boils. My skin became too dry and spotty. I used it with mama earth baby cream still my skin was drying out giving me many burns on face. I stopped using this item and continued my cetaphil cleansing lotion. I will never use mama earth's any product again. I threw away the soaps and moisturizer.\n",
